Production Unit Growth

----------------------



Production UnitGroups automatically increase hitpoints at a rate of

0.7 hitpoints every cycle.  
0.7 is close to the hitpoints/(production time) for 
the production units townhall, 
barracks, elven lumber mill, and blacksmith 
needed to produce low-level combat 
units (implemented in Simulator.java).



Unit Production Rate

--------------------


A production UnitGroup has to pass a threshold amount of hitpoints to begin

unit production.  The threshold depends on the unit to be produced.

	"unit-peasant", 1200		 // assume townhall
	"unit-footman", 1200+800	 // assume townhall and barracks
	"unit-archer", 1200+800+600      // assume townhall, barracks, lumber
 
					 //	mill
       
 "unit-knight", 1200+800+775+500  // assume townhall, barracks,
 
					 // 	blacksmith, stables
	"unit-town-hall", 30		 // assume peasant

(see ActionProduce.java)



Once the production UnitGroup passes the hitpoint threshold, we assume all the

prerequisites for a unit a present, and new units are produced at the rate

specified in units.lua (See build_requirements.yaml).



Examples:


	"unit-peasant"	270

	"unit-archer"	420


TODO: double the rate after passing a second threshold of production UnitGroup

      strength.
