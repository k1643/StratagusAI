Expressing Common Strategy using the Strategy Grammar


The learning group has identified five different Wargus stratagies, and 
they have tools to do automatic labeling of these strategies.  Here we 
express these five strategies using the PPRL strategy language.  The strategies
are given for a player 0 on the one-way-in-one-way-out map.

1. Rush

Goal: to destroy the opponent's economy early.  

Counter Strategy: Power Peasant - building more peasants to 
defend and recover from attack. 

A heuristic for identifying a rush is that a barracks is built before having
12 peasants.

The range of numbers of footmen and archers should be generated to test 
different rushes.

# player 0 attacks region 11
# 
(:strategy rush-0
  (:task produce1 ((:units unit-footman 3 unit-archer 1))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack2) (start produce3))
  )
  # attack enemy base region 11
  (:task attack2 ((:units unit-footman 10)(:region 11))
    :type attack
  )
  # produce defense units for base
  (:task produce3 ((:units unit-footman 10))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack4))
  )
  # defend home base region 1
  (:task attack4 ((:units unit-footman 10)(:region 1))
    :type attack
  )
)

2. Proximity Rush (a.k.a. Proxi Rush)

Goal: to destroy the opponent's economy early.  

Counter Strategy: Power Peasant - building more peasants to 
defend and recover from attack. 

The Proximity Rush differs from a Rush in that buildings that produce combat
units are built near the enemy.  This allows combat units to reach the enemy
faster at the risk of having the building destroyed before the units can be
sent to attack.

# player 0 attacks region 11
# 
(:strategy proxi-rush-0
  # build barracks in region 10
  (:task produce1 ((:units unit-barracks 1)(:region 10))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start produce2))
  )
  # train footmen in region 10
  (:task produce2 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 10))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack3) (start produce4))
  )
  # defend the barracks
  (:task produce4 ((:units unit-footman 3))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack7))
  )
  # defend the barracks in region 10
  (:task attack7 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 11))
    :type attack
  )
  # attack enemy base region 11
  (:task attack3 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 11))
    :type attack
  )
  # produce defense units for base
  (:task produce5 ((:units unit-footman 10)(:region 1))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack6))
  )
  # defend home base region 1
  (:task attack6 ((:units unit-footman 10)(:region 1)) 
    :type attack
  )
)

3. Fast Expansion

Goal: rapidly build production capacty.  This is done by building multiple 
townhalls.

Counter Strategy: Rush

Open map vs. Choke Map is an issue for deciding to do a fast expansion.

Build townhalls near gold mines?

# player 0 attacks region 11
# 
# this fast expansion strategy places 3 town halls in regions 1 and 4.  The
# strategy has 3 duplicate trees.
#
(:strategy fast-expansion-0
  # build town hall in region 1 near goldmine
  (:task produce1 ((:units unit-town-hall 1)(:region 1))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start produce2))
  )
  # train footmen in region 1
  (:task produce2 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 1))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack3) (start produce4))
  )
  # attack enemy base region 11
  (:task attack3 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 11))
    :type attack
  )
  # defend the town hall
  (:task produce4 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 11))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack5))
  )
  # defend the town hall
  (:task attack5 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 11))
    :type attack
  )
  # second copy.  Build another town hall in region 1.
  #
  # build town hall in region 1 near goldmine
  (:task produce6 ((:units unit-town-hall 1)(:region 1)) 
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start produce7))
  )
  # train footmen in region 1
  (:task produce7 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 1))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack8) (start produce9))
  )
  # attack enemy base region 11
  (:task attack8 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 11))
    :type attack
  )
  # defend the town hall
  (:task produce9 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 11))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack5))
  )
  # defend the town hall
  (:task attack10 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 11))
    :type attack
  )
  # third copy.  Build another town hall in region 4.
  #
  # build town hall in region 3 near goldmine
  (:task produce11 ((:units unit-town-hall 1)(:region 3))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start produce12))
  )
  # train footmen in region 3
  (:task produce12 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 3))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack13) (start produce14))
  )
  # attack enemy base region 11
  (:task attack13 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 11))
    :type attack
  )
  # defend the town hall
  (:task produce14 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 3))
    :type produce
    :end(:trigger (start attack5))
  )
  # defend the town hall
  (:task attack14 ((:units unit-footman 3)(:region 3))
    :type attack
  )
)


Sub-strategies

Sub-strategies can be used as part of a strategy.  An example of a sub-strategy
is building a wall of farms to protect a town hall.
